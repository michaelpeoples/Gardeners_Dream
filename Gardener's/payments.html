                <p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE BILL PAYMENT SERVICE

                    SERVICE DEFINITIONS

                    "Service" means the bill payment service offered by Bill Pay through Gardenerâ€™s Dream.


	
                    "Agreement" means these terms and conditions of the bill payment service.



                    "Biller" is the person or entity to which you wish a bill payment to be directed or is the person or entity from which you receive electronic bills, as the case may be.  



                    "Payment Instruction" is the information provided by you to the Service

                    for a bill payment to be made to the Biller (such as, but not limited to, 

                    Biller name, Biller account number, and Scheduled Payment Date).



                    "Payment Account" is the checking account from which bill payments will be debited.



                    "Billing Account" is the checking account from which all Service fees

                    will be automatically debited.



                    "Business Day" is every Monday through Friday, excluding Federal Reserve

                    holidays.



                    "Scheduled Payment Date" is the day you want your Biller to receive your

                    bill payment and is also the day your Payment Account will be debited,

                    unless the Scheduled Payment Date falls on a non-Business Day in which

                    case it will be considered to be the previous Business Day. 



                    "Due Date" is the date reflected on your Biller statement for which the

                    payment is due; it is not the late date or grace period.



                    "Scheduled Payment" is a payment that has been scheduled through the

                    Service but has not begun processing.



                    PAYMENT SCHEDULING

                    The earliest possible Scheduled Payment Date for each Biller (typically

                    four (4) or fewer Business Days from the current date) will be designated

                    within the application when you are scheduling the payment.  Therefore,

                    the application will not permit you to select a Scheduled Payment Date

                    less than the earliest possible Scheduled Payment Date designated for

                    each Biller. When scheduling payments you must select a Scheduled

                    Payment Date that is no later than the actual Due Date reflected on

                    your Biller statement unless the Due Date falls on a non-Business Day.

                    If the actual Due Date falls on a non-Business Day, you must select a

                    Scheduled Payment Date that is at least one (1) Business Day before

                    the actual Due Date. Scheduled Payment Dates must be prior to any late

                    date or grace period.



                    THE SERVICE GUARANTEE

                    Due to circumstances beyond the control of the Service, particularly

                    delays in handling and posting payments by Billers or financial

                    institutions, some transactions may take longer to be credited to

                    your account. The Service will bear responsibility for any late

                    payment related charges up to $50.00 should a payment post after its

                    Due Date as long as the payment was scheduled in accordance with the

                    guidelines described under "Payment Scheduling" in this Agreement.</p>
